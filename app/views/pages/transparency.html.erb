        <p class="lead">We try to pick girls that have demonstrated need, motivation and potential for success.</p>
        <p>The sad fact is that we can’t help every girl in rural Zambia; we don’t have the resources. This makes it especially important to maximize the effect we can have. We do this by having a competetive selection process and trying to make that selection process as fair as possible</p>

        <h2 class="featurette-heading">The Money </h2>
        <p class="lead">We rely completely on donations made on this site.</p>
        <p>We have calculated that it costs about $1,250 to put a girl through secondary school. Once we have collected that money, we keep it until the beginning of the Zambian school year (January). We will pay for one school year at a time in case the girl is unable to finish school. We send the money directly to the school's bank account to minimize fraud. </p>
        <p>Any excess money from over donation or girls who don’t finish school will rolled over to help a different girl. </p>

        <p class="lead">We are a non-profit, but we still have expenses.</p>
        <p>We must pay for things like website hosting, marketing drives, bank fees and office supplies. To do that, we take a small amount of the donation money. We can’t survive without it. We take only what we need, everything else we send to the girls. </p>
