		<h2 class="featurette-heading">Who We Are</h2>
		<p class="lead"> We are Insaka, a 501(c)(3) non-profit dedicated to helping girls in rural Zambia finish their secondary school educations.</p>
		<p>
		Insaka was formed in 2017 by Kyle Uhlmann and Sherrie Welch. The idea of Insaka was born from discussions about Kyle’s recent service as a Peace Corps Volunteer English teacher in Mutwewankoko (Moot-way-wan-coke-oh, <i>head of the chicken</i> in the local language), Zambia.</p>
		<p>
		Most of the girls in Mutwe have no opportunity to continue their education beyond Grade 9. It doesn’t matter how smart they are, how hardworking, or how creative. The girls face so many obstacles: school fees and rampant sexism, for instance, that very few ever attend Grade 10 let alone finish Grade 12. Instead, the majority complete Grade 9, marry early (often by 16), start having children (Total Fertility Rate in 2012 was 5.7 according to UNICEF), and spend the rest of their lives engaged in the back-breaking and neverending labor that characterize the life of a subsistence farmer.</p>
		<p>
		They never have a chance. That’s not fair.</p>
		<p>
		We decided to bring our talents and skills together and do something to help these girls break this cycle. We are both firm believers in the power of education and so have chosen to focus our efforts there. Our goal is to help a steady stream of girls finish secondary school so that they can change their lives, their communities, and our world. Join us.</p>
		<p>
		Special Thanks</p>

		<h2 class="featurette-heading">What We Do</h2>
		<p class="lead">The odds of a rural African girl going to secondary school are slim. There are too many obstacles in her way.
		</p>
		<p>
			One of the largest obstacles is a lack of money. The average yearly income is around $200 (USD). Secondary school fees alone range from $250-$750 per year for three years. Most of these girls come from families of subsistence farmers. Few of their families have that much money, and even if they do, the money is much more likely to be spent educating the sons of the family, not the daughters.
		</p>
		<p>
			Our goal is to help rural African girls complete their Grade 12 educations by assisting in the payment of their school fees.
		</p>
		<p>
		Girls who choose to do so may apply for this help. It must be their choice. Our intention is to provide educational assistance for up to five girls a year so that we may ensure that the contributions go directly to where they are most needed.</p>

		<p class="lead">Women's education has been shown to have many positive effects on the community. Women with secondary education can go on to become schoolteachers, clinic workers, community health workers, and fill numerous other beneficial roles within their communities.</p>
