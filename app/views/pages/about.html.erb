		<h2 class="featurette-heading">Who We Are</h2>
		<p class="lead"> We are Insaka, a 501(c)(3) non-profit dedicated to helping girls in rural Zambia finish their secondary school educations.</p>
		<p>
		Insaka was formed in 2017 by Kyle Uhlmann and Sherrie Welch. The idea of Insaka was born from discussions about Kyle’s recent service as a Peace Corps Volunteer teaching English in Mutwewankoko (<i>head of the chicken</i> in the local language), Zambia.</p>
		<p>
		Most of the girls in Mutwe have no opportunity to continue their education beyond Grade 9. It doesn’t matter how smart they are, how hardworking, or how creative. The girls face so many obstacles: school fees and gender inequalities, which mean few ever attend Grade 10, let alone finish Grade 12. Instead, the majority complete Grade 9, marry early, start having children, and spend the rest of their lives engaged in the back-breaking and never ending labor that characterize the life of a subsistence farmer.</p>
		<p>
		They never have a chance.</p>
		<p>
		We decided to bring our talents and skills together and do something to help these girls break this cycle. We are both firm believers in the power of education and so have chosen to focus our efforts there. Our goal is to help a steady stream of girls finish secondary school so that they can change their lives, their communities, and our world. Join us.</p>

			<h2 class="featurette-heading">What We Do</h2>
			<p class="lead">The odds of a rural Zambian girl going to secondary school are slim. There are too many obstacles in her way.</p>
			<p>One of the largest obstacles is a lack of money. The average yearly cash income in rural areas can be extremely low, often less than $500 USD. Secondary school fees range from $275-$800 USD per year for three years. That is just tuition. It does not include transport to school, uniforms, school supplies, etc. </p>
			<p>Most of these girls come from families of subsistence farmers. Their families don’t have much money, and what money they can save for education, is usually spent on the sons. Our goal is to help girls complete their Grade 12 educations by assisting in the payment of their school fees. </p>
			<p> We created Insaka as a means to connect donors to girls who have been deemed as having high levels of need, motivation and potential for success. We collect donations, via this website, and then use them to pay all three years’ worth of secondary school fees for the selected girls.</p>
			<p>Our aim at the moment is to assist five girls per year. </p>
